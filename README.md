# Supervised Machine Learning

In this Challenge we were asked to determine which technique would be good at predicting loans that would be high risk. The four techniques that were used included:

* Naive Random Sampling
* SMOTE Oversampling
* Undersampling
* Combination (Over and Under) Sampling

Please see the jupyter notebook for the analysis.
