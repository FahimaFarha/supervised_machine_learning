# Supervised Machine Learning

In this Challenge, we were asked to use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to determine what model is best to use when trying to determine credit risk.

## Oversampling
After resampling the data with RandomOverSampler and training it with Logistic Regression model, we calculated the balanced accuracy score to be 65%. When looking at this at first glance, one would assume that this is a great score. However, we need to
